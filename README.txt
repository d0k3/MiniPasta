MiniPasta2

This software patches your 3ds firmware's signature checks in RAM then reboots to home menu.
This means you can run cias until power off or reboot. This does not contain emunand or other fancy CFW stuff.
Safe for sysupdater.cia homebrew usage. That's the main intent of this software.

Mainly for use on firm 9.3 - 9.4 (works ok-ish on 9.0 - 9.2. -- old3ds)
Use original MiniPasta for firm 4.1 - 9.2

Use this method to install first cia:
Boot hbmenu > MiniPasta2 > hbmenu > FBI.3dsx > install your cia installer of choice

Note: on 9.3 - 9.4
-Expect about 20% boot rate on new3ds, 50% on old3ds. Keep trying!
-Turn on wifi: this seems to help the memchunkhax2 success rate
